# DAY-1 🌊 AQUA - AI Voice Conversational Agent

AQUA is a fully interactive voice conversational agent that runs locally on your machine.  
It listens to your voice, "thinks" using Google's advanced Gemini AI, and replies with a realistic human voice.

It acts like a real-time phone call or voice assistant (similar to Siri or ChatGPT Voice Mode).
